  <p id="graphicabout">This poster was created for an infographics class taught by Alberto Cairo. I am extremely interested in public health, and I wanted to
    illustrate the importance of water and its affects on the body. I enjoyed researching this topic and intend on doing a follow-up graphic on water quality in the United States.</p>

  <p id="graphicabout">I created this infographic to raise awareness on the prevalence of concussions in hockey. I've been a hockey fan all my life
    and think the dangers of the sport are often overlooked. There is no way to prevent concussions in hockey aside from avoiding contact all together, but great strides have been made in concussion research, understanding, and care.</p>
