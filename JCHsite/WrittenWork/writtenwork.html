<p id="writingbio">Writing has always been one of my strongest suits, and has bloomed into a passion that I am continually striving
  to improve. I believe being able to express yourself on the page unlocks doors many others may not have the opportunity to open.
  I look forward to having a career that utilizes my passion and talent with words.

<h2>MindBodyMVMT</h2>
<p id="mbmbio">I was a principal creator of my previous employer's blog, mindmodymvmt.com. The lifestyle site
    took months of researching, designing, and preparation to complete. I worked side-by-side with my boss throughout the process,
    and was responsible for editing all content on the site. I also conducted interviews for profiles of individuals that
    the business works closely with. Below are links to a few of my favorite pieces.</p>

<h2>Garnet and Black</h2>
<p id="gandb">During my undergraduate studies at the University of South Carolina, I became heavily involved with the student-run publication, <em>Garnet and Black</em>.
  Over the course of about two and a half years, I held multiple positions, including writer, section editor, and managing stylist.
