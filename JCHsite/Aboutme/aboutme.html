    <p id="me">A native northerner, I escaped the cold just before beginning my undergraduate studies and have managed to
      live in continually warmer places since. I graduated magna cum laude from the University of South
      Carolina with a degree in business and a minor in retailing in 2013. I wrote for and became an editor
      of the school's magazine, <em>Garnet and Black</em>, a position that truly sparked my love
      for journalism. From there, I moved down to the Big Easy (New Orleans, for those who aren't familiar), where I managed a three-story boutique
      fitness studio. I am passionate about health and wellness, and learned a wealth of information from some of the
      most knowledgable in the fitness industry through that experience. Today, I am working towards a master's degree in journalism
      from the University of Miami with specific areas of interest in broadcast and filmmaking.
